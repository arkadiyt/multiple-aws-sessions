long time pain point
conceptually knew it was possible to hook or modify cookies (though there are some really important changes in chrome v2 / v3 manifests around _how_ to do this)
thought: what if I could keep track of which tab receives which cookies. Then on any outgoing request from the tab, replace the cookies it sends with the ones received previoiusly for that tab
started playing around in devtools inspector, aws sets more than a dozen cookies across various domains, regional endpoints, etc
  but by playing around with it, for instance by deleting a cookie and seeing if i was still logged in on refresh, narrowed it down to just 3 cookies: aws-creds, aws-userInfo, and aws-userInfo-signed
got a basic chrome extension working that hooked those cookies, but i was still getting logged out. why?
  - dumb cookie overwriting thing with cookiejar, probably not worth mentioning
  - opened up burp suite and started comparing my requests to unmodified logins. noticed that aws-creds value was changing, e.g. received <sample value> in set-cookie response, but then later the browser was sending <modifed value>
  - looks like they use javascript to modify it? (wrong)
  - time to reverse engineer. had to find where in javascript the change is happening, but there's a lot of javascript loaded. injected a script to trigger the debugger
got past that error, home screen is loading successfully now, nice! but any page load gives me signed out error
